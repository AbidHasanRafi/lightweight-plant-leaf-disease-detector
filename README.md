# ðŸŒ¿ Lightweight Plant Leaf Disease Detector

A deep learning-powered web application designed to diagnose plant diseases from leaf images, utilizing Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize the areas of the leaf that influenced the model's decision.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Disease Detection**: Diagnoses 20 common plant diseases across multiple species with high precision.
- **Model Explainability**: Utilizes Grad-CAM to visually highlight the areas of the leaf that most influenced the modelâ€™s predictions.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to the user's preferred theme.
- **Confidence Metrics**: Displays prediction probabilities to showcase the model's certainty.

## Dataset

The model is trained using a dataset that contains images of plant leaves, labeled with their corresponding diseases. You can test the app using the images from the dataset. The dataset can be accessed from the following Kaggle link:

## Model Architecture
```python
# model architecture
class PlantDiseaseCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(PlantDiseaseCNN, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(32),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Conv2d(32, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1, groups=32, bias=False),
            nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(64),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1, groups=64, bias=False),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(128),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 128, kernel_size=1),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1),
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(128, num_classes)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        features = self.features[:-1](x)
        attention = self.features[-1](features)
        attended = features * attention
        return self.classifier(attended)
```

The application leverages a custom lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for efficiency and performance:
- **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Enhances feature learning and improves model performance.
- **Compact Architecture**: The model consists of only 128,000 parameters, making it highly efficient.
