# ðŸŒ¿ Lightweight Plant Leaf Disease Detector with Grad-CAM

A deep learning-powered web application designed to diagnose plant diseases from leaf images, utilizing Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize the areas of the leaf that influenced the model's decision.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Disease Detection**: Diagnoses 20 common plant diseases across multiple species with high precision.
- **Model Explainability**: Utilizes Grad-CAM to visually highlight the areas of the leaf that most influenced the modelâ€™s predictions.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to the user's preferred theme.
- **Confidence Metrics**: Displays prediction probabilities to showcase the model's certainty.

## Model Architecture

The application leverages a custom lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for efficiency and performance:
- **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Enhances feature learning and improves model performance.
- **Compact Architecture**: The model consists of only 128,000 parameters, making it highly efficient.
